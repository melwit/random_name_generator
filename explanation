Our goal for this project is to write a program which creates random names. That should include a random first name, a random last name and a title in front of the last name. We have different lists and every list includes umpteen syllables. (The more syllables our lists contain the more random get our name. Because there are more possibilities. Otherwise it could be, that the names get similar all the time.) To create random names from this syllables we write at least three methods. One for the last name, one for the first name and the other for the title so that very special names such as "Kenmarkar Di Wargarmohrgus" occur. We want that input of the function decides which length the names should have. 

To get a random syllbale from the list we use the random.uniform(0,1) function. Then we multiply the random float with the length of the list minus 1. We do so because we have to cover the case that random.uniform returns 1. When it does so the index should be the last syllable of the list and as we know the list starts at the index 0, so we need to subtract 1 from the length of the list. Just to break determinism of random we set the random.seed() as a variable millis = int(round(time.time() * 1000)). So that everytime the program get started the names are in a different order.

The three methods are quite similar. Each method contains a for loop "for i in range(length):" the variable length is the length of the name the user wants. If the value of length is for example 3 the function will return a string of three syllables. Except for the title of the last name. There is the length already set to 1 because the title can not contain more than one syllable. Each of these methods return a string. But there is still one essential difference between them. First of all the method "def getFirstName(length): will create random names from the list syllables_firstname and def getLastName(length): from the list syllables_lastname
We also defined a function called def setWholeName(firstNameLength, lastNameLength):. This is pretty much the main method because that's the function that gets executed. Within this method the others will get executed and it will return the whole name set together as a string.
